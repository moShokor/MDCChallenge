First intall the requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Task1-shallow.ipynb** gives a shallow approach to solve Task1, in **Task1_BERT.ipynb** we fine tune BERT instead and improve the results further(Note that this model was trained on Google collab).
Finally **Task2.ipynb** includes two approaches to solve task2, using LDA and using Topic2Vec
